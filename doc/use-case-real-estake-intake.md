# Real Estate Interested Party Workflow

## Premise

Potential home buyer is standing in front of a home for sale. They see the sign
and it says to text 78787 to 43333. The text is an information rich request that
includes your phone number, location, and what sort of home you might be
interested in purchasing. You are entered as a lead into a system and the
realtors want to make sure they sell you a home.

The challenge here: some of the intake has already been completed as a result
of the initial text message.

## Questions

Italicized questions have answers from the text message that may need
validation.

1. _What’s your phone number?_
2. _In what city are you looking to purchase a house?_
3. _Approximately what type of home are you looking to purchase?_
4. Are you already working with a realtor?
5. What is your name?
6. How soon are you looking to purchase?
7. Have you been pre-approved for a home loan?
8. Has anyone already been in touch?
9. Has anyone spoken to you in the last week?

## Workflow

1. Lead comes in via text message
2. Agent reaches out to person who called via phone and asks questions
3. Agent entered information into system
4. That agent or a more appropriate agent for this buyer begins to work with buyer
5. …
6. Profit!
